short-description: "An exciting two-day hackathon, for students from any university."

full-description: >
  Royal Hackaway is Royal Holloway's annual hackathon.

  Open to university students from the UK and around the world,
  in this two-day hackathon you'll work as a team to build a project.
  You'll pick up new skills, try out new tech, and meet new people.
  This is our third time running this event, and we're excited to
  create a more inclusive and rewarding event for all.
